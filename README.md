# Explainable Detection of Online Sexism using NLP
CSE440 Project

This is my first project using NLP on "Explainable Detection of Online Sexism". This project aims to classify a sentence as sexist or not sexist with the help of NLP tools. The GloVe Embeddings can be downloaded from kaggle and the link is given in "glove download".
